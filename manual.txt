Description: This program is used to do the semantic
analysis of a syntax tree created by our previous
assignment.

To Run the Program:
a. Download a3.zip and extract contents to your 
desired location.

b. Open Terminal/Command Prompt etc. and navigate
to the now extracted "a3" folder
using the "cd" command.

*Note that stebs c and d are only required if the flex
or bison files are changed.
c. Compile the flex file using the command

$ flex CM.flex

d. Compile the bison file using the command

$ bison -vd CM.y

d. Now you may execute the makefile for the program 
using the command

$ make

e. In order to execute on a text file use the 
command where "test.CM" is a stand-in for whatever
C- file you wish to analyze

$ ./parser test.CM

f. The parser will now perform a semantic analysis of the 
code, and print out the relevant symbol table details and
type checking results to the terminal

Notes:
This program fully implements the basic Assignment 3
requirements and has demonstrated an ability to match the sample
input/output that was provided as well as several other
examples. This program does not implement the bonus part.
